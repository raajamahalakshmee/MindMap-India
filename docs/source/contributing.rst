### Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report, please check if the issue has already been reported. If it hasn't, you can create a new issue with the following information:

1. **Clear, descriptive title**
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Expected behavior**
4. **Actual behavior**
5. **Screenshots** (if applicable)
6. **Environment** (OS, browser, Python version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for new features or improvements. When suggesting an enhancement, please include:

1. A clear, descriptive title
2. A detailed description of the enhancement
3. Why you think this would be valuable
4. Any examples or mockups (if applicable)

### Your First Code Contribution

If you're new to open source or the project, look for issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted". These are typically smaller, well-defined tasks that are good for newcomers.

### Improving Documentation

Good documentation is crucial for any project. You can help by:

- Fixing typos and grammatical errors
- Improving existing documentation
- Adding examples or clarifying complex concepts
- Translating documentation to other languages

Setting Up for Development
-------------------------

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- pip (Python package manager)

### Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mindmap-india.git
   cd mindmap-india
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/yourusername/mindmap-india.git
   ```

### Set Up a Virtual Environment

We recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install core requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Verify Your Setup

```bash
# Run tests to verify everything is working
pytest
```

Development Workflow
-------------------

1. **Sync your fork** with the latest changes from upstream:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Create a new branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b bugfix/issue-number-description
   ```

3. **Make your changes** following the code style guide

4. **Run tests** to ensure nothing is broken:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

5. **Commit your changes** with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your detailed commit message"
   ```

6. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request** from your fork to the upstream repository

Code Style Guide
----------------

### Python

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for static type checking

Run these before committing:

```bash
black .
isort .
flake8 .
mypy .
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript

(If applicable to your project)

- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Use ESLint for linting

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - ‚ú® `:sparkles:` When adding a new feature
  - üêõ `:bug:` When fixing a bug
  - ‚ôªÔ∏è `:recycle:` When refactoring code
  - üìö `:books:` When writing docs
  - üöÄ `:rocket:` When improving performance
  - üöß `:construction:` WIP (Work In Progress) commits
  - üîß `:wrench:` When updating configuration
  - ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` When adding or updating tests

Testing
-------

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Name test files with the prefix `test_`
- Place test files in the `tests/` directory
- Use descriptive test function names starting with `test_`

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/test_clustering.py -v

# Run tests in parallel
pytest -n auto
```

### Test Coverage

We aim for high test coverage. Before submitting a PR, ensure your changes are well-tested.

To generate a coverage report:

```bash
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
# Open htmlcov/index.html in your browser
```

Documentation
-------------

### Code Documentation

- Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Include type hints for function parameters and return values
- Document complex algorithms and non-obvious code

### User Documentation

- Keep the user guide up to date with new features
- Add screenshots for UI changes
- Document any changes to the user interface

### Building Documentation

To build the documentation locally:

```bash
cd docs
make html  # Requires make and sphinx to be installed
# The built documentation will be in docs/_build/html
```

Submitting Changes
-----------------

1. **Ensure tests pass** on your local machine
2. **Update documentation** for any new features or changes
3. **Squash your commits** into logical units of work
4. **Push your changes** to your fork
5. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear description of your changes

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Fill out the PR template completely
- Reference any related issues
- Include screenshots or GIFs for UI changes
- Ensure all tests pass on the CI
- Get a code review from at least one maintainer

Code Review Process
------------------

1. A maintainer will review your PR as soon as possible
2. We may request changes or ask for clarification
3. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR
4. Your contribution will be included in the next release

### Review Guidelines

When reviewing PRs:

- Be kind and constructive
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Explain your reasoning for requested changes
- Suggest improvements rather than just pointing out problems
- Thank the contributor for their time and effort
